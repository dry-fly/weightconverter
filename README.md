# weightconverter

Install python3  
Install pip (Note: Python 3.12.0 for Windows will also install Pip)  
Setup Github account
Install git
Create SSH key, add to Github account, and configure git to use SSH key (see Github docs link below)

In a directory for your coding projects (i.e. c:\path\to\projects\) clone this repository:  git clone git@github.com:dry-fly/weightconverter.git  
Change into the weightconverter directory
Create a Python virtual environment: python -m venv .venv  

Activate the virtual environment:  
* On Windows, run:  tutorial-env\Scripts\activate  
* On Unix or MacOS, run:  source tutorial-env/bin/activate

Now to mess with git.  See git_commands.txt.  
Use that to add weightconverter.py to your local branch, commmit it, and then push it to this repo.  
!! but actually to do that, I'd have to give you access to this repo, so you'd need a Github account first.  
!! alternatively, I think you can create a fork maybe?  I dunno.
